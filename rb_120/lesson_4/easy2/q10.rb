What are the benefits of using Object Oriented Programming in Ruby? Think of as many as you can.

1. Being able to create hierarchies of classes and objects to organize your code and minimize redunancies
2. Grouping like methods or classes together (namespacing), to more easily find the route to problems
3. Creating objects represented by nouns are easier to conceputalize
4. build faster since we can use pre-written code
5. more complex software is more easily managed
