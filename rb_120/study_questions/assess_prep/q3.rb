#3 â€” What concept does the following code aim to demonstrate?

This code is an example of polymorhism through interface inheritance.
This is where modules are mixed in to a class to provide shared behvaiour 
across different classes. 
This is polymorphism becuase objects of different types can respond to the 
same method invocation "greet" and it is done with intension.
