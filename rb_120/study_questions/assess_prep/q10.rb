"STEVIE WONDER"
"STEVIE WONDER"

This is because we are mutating the calling object in our artist
setter method. Even though a setter method returns the arguments passed
in, we mutated it through a destructive method call of #upcase! which
mutates its caller.

the value reference by name and @artist is affected as the are both 
pointing to the same object in space.
