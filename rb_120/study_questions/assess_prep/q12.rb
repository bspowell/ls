#12 â€” What will the last two lines of code output?

[Bugs, Bunny, Run, Walk, Jump, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]
"Running"

When we use the namespace resolution method, we are telling 
Ruby where to look for the constant STR. It first looks within 
it's lexical scope, then since it can't find it within Bugs, it 
looks within its inhertiance chain. The first occurance it finds
is within the module Run and returns "Running" which is outputted
to the screen.
